## UI Design Principles

### Color Scheme
- Primary Background: White (#FFFFFF)
- Primary Button Color: Black (#000000)
- Text on Dark Backgrounds: White (#FFFFFF)
- Text on Light Backgrounds: Dark Gray (#333333)
- Accent Color: Blue (#2D9CDB) for highlighting key elements and actions
- Success: Green (#4CAF50)
- Error: Red (#F44336)

### Typography
- Primary Font: A modern sans-serif font like SF Pro Text or Roboto
- Headings: Bold weight, clean and large
- Body Text: Regular weight, with excellent readability at all sizes
- Button Text: Medium weight for clarity

### Layout Guidelines
- Ultra-clean, minimalist interfaces inspired by Uber
- High contrast between interactive elements
- Card-based design with subtle shadows
- Bottom tab navigation for main sections
- Pull-to-refresh for content updates
- Infinite scrolling for product listings
- Prominent CTAs with adequate touch targets

### Visual Elements
- High-quality product photography with consistent styling
- Purposeful micro-interactions and transitions (Uber-like)
- Simple, bold iconography with clear meaning
- Progress indicators for multi-step processes
- Strategic use of blue accent color for important actions
- Generous negative space to emphasize content
- Smooth loading states and skeletons for content

## Security Considerations

### Authentication Security
- Secure token storage using AsyncStorage with appropriate encryption
- Automatic token refresh mechanism
- Session timeout handling
- Biometric authentication option (TouchID/FaceID) for enhanced security

### Data Protection
- Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure:
  - Users can only access their own profile data
  - Users can only view their own reservations
  - Users can only view their own support requests
  - Public read-only access to golf cart catalog

### Input Validation
- Client-side validation for all forms
- Server-side validation through Supabase policies
- Sanitization of inputs to prevent injection attacks

### API Security
- HTTPS for all communications
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

## Potential Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Performance with Image-Heavy Content
**Problem**: Golf cart listings with multiple high-quality images could lead to performance issues.
**Solution**: Implement image optimization, lazy loading, and caching strategies. Use Supabase Storage with CDN for faster image delivery.

### Challenge 2: Complex Reservation Management
**Problem**: Coordinating between app reservations and company representatives might be challenging.
**Solution**: Implement a notification system for new reservations and status updates. Consider adding an admin dashboard in a future phase.

### Challenge 3: Cross-Platform Consistency
**Problem**: Ensuring a consistent luxury feel across both iOS and Android.
**Solution**: Use NativeBase components that adapt to platform guidelines while maintaining visual consistency. Implement platform-specific code only when necessary.

### Challenge 4: User Engagement
**Problem**: Encouraging users to return to the app after initial browsing.
**Solution**: Implement push notifications for reservation updates and new model releases. Consider adding a "favorites" feature for users to save carts they're interested in.
